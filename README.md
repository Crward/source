This repo is a clone of George Hayward's Vassal modules for Multiman Publishing's Operational Combat System (OCS).
Mr. Hayward passed away late in 2013 or early 2014.  Among his legacies was a a large corpus of work on the Vassal modules
for OCS, including a number of custom-developed extensions for the Vassal utility.  

I am unsure where this repo was originally hosted -- as I recall it was among the subdirectories for vassal development, 
but I've lost the exact address.
