This repo is a clone of George Hayward's Vassal modules for Multiman Publishing's Operational Combat System (OCS).
Mr. Hayward passed away late in 2013 or early 2014. A very partial appreciation of his work for the wargaming community can be found in the OCS discussion thread at Consimworld.

Among his legacies was a a large corpus of work on the Vassal modules
for OCS, including a number of custom-developed extensions for the Vassal utility.  

I am unsure where this repo was originally hosted -- as I recall it was among the subdirectories for vassal development, 
but I've lost the exact address.

The Source directory splits into "Net" and "COM," then a fairly long trail of subdirectories leads to his work on OCS
(in Net) and Twilight in the Easte (TITE) (in COM).
